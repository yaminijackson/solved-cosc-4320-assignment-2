<ol>

 <li>Liverpool is a very good football/ soccer team in English premium league. The stadium holds 15,000 people. <strong>The number of people attending one of their games</strong> is <strong>related to the number of people attending the previous game</strong> and <strong>the results from the previous two game in the following manner </strong></li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>The attendance increases according to <strong>a logistic model</strong> when the team has won both of its previous game</li>

 <li>If the team wins one and draws one of its last two games, the crowed will increase in a <strong>linear fashion</strong></li>

 <li>If the team loses both games, the crowd size will decrease geometrically</li>

 <li>Any other possibilities result in a linear decrease</li>

 <li>The result of 2108/2019 season were as follows</li>

</ul>

<ul>

 <li>Develop a discrete time model that illustrates the attendance for the season. Make the following assumptions o The attendance in the first game was 8,000</li>

</ul>

o The initial growth rate for logistic and linear components is 10 % o Decay rate for losing both games is 10 %

<ul>

 <li>Provide functionality Python code to implement the model and graphical output to show the results</li>

</ul>
